More and more robots are coming into human's daily life,
\eg, autonomous driving car and household robot.
Unlike traditional robots in the factory, robots that share the
same workspace with humans have to (i) gather information on humans'
physical state and mental state;
and (ii) take actions to achieve their own objectives.
Currently, most robots rely purely on onboard sensors to gather 
information, such as lidar and camera.
However, those sensors might fail due to weather or lighting
conditions, which might result in fatal accidents.
% topic
This paper introduces NRC, 
a decentralized platform built on NEO blockchain
for trust-free human-robot communication.
With \nrc, the human and the robot are able to broadcast their
information via blockchain, and receive the 
information of other agents for decision making.
% the adavantage of NER, and the impact
% 1. compared with onboard sensors
Compared with the onboard sensors, NRC can provides additional 
information for the robot, which can not be achieved by onboard
sensors.
For example, with \nrc, the robot will be able to know the 
position of the
human when they are separated by an obstacle in the middle, 
% 2. compared with the traditional communication device
Compared to the traditional communication devices, the blockchain based
NRC provides serveral adavantages:
(i) it reduces the cost of trust, \ie, the human and the robot can trust
the information they received is correct. This is handled automatically
by the blockchain technology without any extra effort.
(ii) the NRC token gives incentive for the human to share
their information to the robots, \ie, the human gets paid instantly
when his/her information is used by a robot.
As a proof of concept, we test NRC in the scenario of autonomous driving,
where we demonstrate the adavantages that NRC provides.
Note that NRC is general and not limit to autonomous driving. 
It can
be potentially applied on any robots that share their workspace
with humans, \eg, service robots in restaurants or hospitals.

\section{Introduction}

% Motivation
In the past decades, dramatic prograss has been made in the field
of robotics.
Robots are moving from factories, where robots have their own workspace,
into people's daily life, where robots share their workspace with humans (\figref{fig:robots}).
% Examples
There is an urgent need for developing robotic systems that can work closely with
human without hurting human or disturbing human's working flow.

% challenges in robot collaborating with humans
Unlike industrial robots,
robot that working closely with human has to 
reason over human's 
physical state and mental state;
and plan its own actions accordingly.

    \begin{subfigure}{1.0\linewidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{intersection_nav.pdf}

        Autonomous car (red) navigating through an unsignalized 
        intersection, with another human driven car (green) around. 
        Right column:
        The onboard sensors might fail due to unexpected obstacles,
        \eg, trees around the road.
    }
    \label{fig:intersection_nav}
\end{figure}


% take an example to explain what is human's mental state, and why it is difficult
Consider an autonomous driving example in~\figref{fig:intersection_nav} (left column).
The autonomous car tries to navigate through an unsignalized intersection
while interacting with another human driver on road. 
Although it is a trival task for human drivers, it
turns out to be extremely difficult for a robot car to perform 
well in such scenario. 
In order to be safe and efficient, 
the robot car needs to 
know the positions of nearby human driven cars and the paths that 
human drivers are following.


% Current robots rely on onboard sensors
Nowadays, most robots rely purely on onboard sensors,
\eg, lidar and camera \etc,
to gather information from the environment. 
Onboard sensors provides only limited information for the
robot due to the following reasons.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Onboard sensors lack the ability to read humans' mental 
        state, \eg, the sensors will not be able to tell 
        which direction the huma driver is going
        (\figref{fig:intersection_nav}, left column).
    \item Onboard sensors can fail due to unexpected weather
        conditions or obstacles, \eg, the sensors is blocked
        by a tree in the autonomous driving task
        (\figref{fig:intersection_nav}, right column).
\end{itemize}


% Introduce NRC
In this paper, we introduce \nrc, a dApp based 
on NEO blockchain that enables trust-free human-robot 
communication.


% Differentiate NRC from traditional communication devices


% Preliminary results on testing NRC on a robot platform
We tested \nrc on the autonomous driving task as a proof of
concept.
(TODO: Preliminary results)


% Impact of NRC
We believe that robots will become more and more popular in
people's daily life, and \nrc provides a general solution
for human-robot information sharing.
Note that, although we demonstrated \nrc on the autonomous
driving task, \nrc is much more general and it can
be potentially applied on any robots that share their workspace
with humans, \eg, service robots in restaurants or hospitals.
